Outline for the program

- remap.c (main program file)
	
	- read in the input data.  This means
		- File(s) for alpha1/2
		- File for the SL images (in SWUnited format)
		- <optional, add later> magnification map
		
	- For the specified image system(s):
		- calculate the source position for each image in the system
		- calculate the "best" source position for the full image system
		- calculate all image positions for the best position
		- Determine which (if any) of the calculated positions are new.
		
- remap_source.c (collection of functions to be used in remap.c)

	Function list:
	- memory allocation/freeing (might be good to do a general fits- input setup too)
	- source position from image position
		- convert RA, Dec to pixels
		- interpolate alpha between pixel locations (degree=? linear or more?)
		- beta = theta - alpha
	- image position from source position (hard!)
		- get beta for each pixel in the field
		- define search regions in image plane (places that map close enough to best 
		source position in src plane).  "Depth first graph traversal" may be a good idea
		- within each region find the point that lenses back to the best source position
	- image association (this idea may have issues with parity, FYI. mag may help fix)
		- check that N_data_img > N_model_img
		- find the closest pair of data/model images. Mark as paired, pop off the stack
		- continue until all data images are exhausted
		- mark remaining model images as new
	- chisq evaluation for "best" among images
