#### Restructure imremap.c to exclude unnecessary junk

# Restructure/review include files

# Making imremap.c compatible with new SL inputs
	# start with only taking in the alpha1 and alpha2 maps from fits files

# document/comment 

# rename variables/functions to be more descriptive 

# Verify image positions are correct with lenstool, e.g.

# Makefile
	# Making sure we have the right libraries/include files, etc.

# Modify/update imremap_source.c to efficiently do the computations
	### Write a new function (maybe for v1.1 once v1.0 is done...) in imremap_source.c to use a variable source plane position as reference point
	### Currently, lenseq_f_remap() uses the average soure plane position as a reference point
